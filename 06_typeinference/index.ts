// Type inference
let message = "Hello World"; /// typescript automatically assumed this variable store sting data type that's call type interference

// Difference between Type inference and type annotation
// 1. Type inference
let avenger = "Hulk"; /// if we know the default value of this variable it's called type inference

// 2. Type annotation
let favAvenger: string = "Iron man"; /// if we don't know the default value of this variable it's called type annotation
